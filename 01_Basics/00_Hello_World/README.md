# 00 - Hello, World!

Welcome to your very first step in writing Python code! The "Hello, World!" program is a time-honored tradition for programmers learning a new language. It's simple, yet it confirms that your development environment is correctly set up and you can successfully execute code.

## What is "Hello, World!"?

The "Hello, World!" program is typically the simplest possible program that outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the console or screen. Its primary purpose is to:

1.  **Verify Environment Setup:** It's a quick check to ensure that your Python interpreter is installed correctly and that you can run Python scripts.
2.  **Introduce Basic Syntax:** It demonstrates the most fundamental command for outputting text in Python.

You can see the code for this in the [01_hello.py](./01_hello.py) file.

## Comments in Python

Comments are lines in your code that the Python interpreter ignores. They are crucial for making your code understandable to humans (including your future self!). Good comments explain the "why" behind your code, not just the "what".

Python has two main types of comments:

1.  **Single-line comments:** These start with a hash symbol (`#`). Everything after the `#` on that line is considered a comment.
2.  **Multi-line comments (Docstrings):** While technically multi-line strings, they are often used as comments when not assigned to a variable. They are enclosed in triple quotes (`"""..."""` or `'''...'''`).

To see comments in action, check out the [02_comment.py](./02_comment.py) file.

## How to Run These Programs

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to this folder:**
    ```bash
    cd 01_Basics/00_Hello_World/
    ```
3.  **Run the Python scripts:**
    To run the "Hello, World!" program:
    ```bash
    python 01_hello.py
    ```
    To run the comments example:
    ```bash
    python 02_comment.py
    ```

Congratulations on running your first Python programs!
