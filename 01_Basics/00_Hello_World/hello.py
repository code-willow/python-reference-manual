# This is a single-line comment.
# Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and are used to explain the code.

# The 'print()' function is a built-in Python function.
# It is used to display output to the console (or screen).
# The text inside the parentheses and quotes is called a 'string literal'.
print("Hello, World!")  # This will print Hello, World! to your screen.

# You can also use triple quotes for multi-line comments, though they are technically multi-line strings not assigned to a variable.

This is a multi-line comment (or a multi-line string used as a comment).
It can span across multiple lines.
This program simply prints the classic "Hello, World!" message to the console.
It's often the first program new developers write to ensure their environment is set up correctly.
