# This is a single-line comment.
# Python ignores everything from the '#' symbol to the end of the line.

# Comments are used to explain what your code does.
# They are for human readers, not for the computer.

# For example, the next line of code will print a message to the screen.
print("This line is not a comment and will be executed.")

# print("This line is commented out, so it won't run.")

"""
This is a multi-line string, but it's often used as a multi-line comment.
It's a good way to write longer comments that span multiple lines.
Technically, it's a string that isn't assigned to any variable, so Python
just ignores it.

You can also use single triple quotes for the same purpose.
