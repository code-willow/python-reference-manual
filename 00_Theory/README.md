# Part 1: The Theoretical Foundation

Welcome to the Python Reference Manual! This `00_Theory` section is the first and most crucial part of your learning journey. Before we dive into writing code, it's essential to build a strong theoretical foundation. A good programmer doesn't just know *how* to write code, but *why* the code works the way it does.

This section is divided into two main parts:

### 1. [Introduction to Computer Science](./01_Introduction_to_CS/)

Here, we cover the timeless principles of computer science that apply to any programming language. Understanding these concepts will make you a more effective problem-solver and a better programmer.

-   **Topics covered:** Variables, Data Structures, Algorithms, Control Flow, Functions, and Object-Oriented Programming.

### 2. [Introduction to Python](./02_Intro_to_Python/)

In this part, we introduce the Python language itself. We'll look at its history, what makes it special, and how to get it set up on your computer. This will be the bridge between the abstract concepts of computer science and the practical world of Python programming.

-   **Topics covered:** General programming concepts, an introduction to Python, and setting up your development environment.

By the end of this section, you will have the foundational knowledge required to start writing Python code with confidence. Let's begin!
